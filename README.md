# Diabetes_Prediction

Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning
Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to predict whether a person has diabetes based on various health parameters. The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. The model is built using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel for classification.

Features
Data preprocessing and standardization
Training and testing using SVM
Model evaluation with accuracy scores
Predictive system for new patient data
Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:

Pregnancies
Glucose Level
Blood Pressure
Skin Thickness
Insulin Level
BMI (Body Mass Index)
Diabetes Pedigree Function
Age
Outcome (0: Non-Diabetic, 1: Diabetic)
Dependencies
Python 3
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Results
The model achieves the following accuracy:

Training Accuracy: ~ (Varies based on dataset split)
Test Accuracy: ~ (Varies based on dataset split)
Future Improvements
Implement other models like Random Forest or Neural Networks
Improve feature engineering and data preprocessing
Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit
